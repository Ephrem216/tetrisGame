My biggest project tetris - created with pygame

This game is my biggest project built using the Python framework
Pygame. It's an updated version of the classic Tetris game we used
to play on button phones. I designed and developed it innovatively
without internet connections in the first half of this year. The
game consists of over 1500 lines of code.
